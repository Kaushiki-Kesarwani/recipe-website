              <h2>How to make muffins</h2>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  Preheat and prep pan. Preheat oven to 425°F and line a

                </li>
                <li>
                  Make muffin batter. Using an electric mixer, cream together

                  creamy.Add eggs, vanilla, and milk and mix until well

              <h2>Ingredients</h2>

              <ul class="Ingredients">
                <li>6 eggs</li>
                <li>13.25 oz box chocolate cake mix</li>
                <li>⅓ cup water</li>
                <li>¼ cup vegetable oil or canola</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon powdered sugar</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>How to make Cake</h2>

              <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350ºF.</li>
                <li>
                  Beat eggs. In a large bowl, beat eggs with an electric mixer
                  for 5 minutes until frothy and pale yellow in color.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Create batter. Add cake mix, water and oil and beat on low for
                  2 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Prepare baking sheet. Line a baking pan with parchment paper
                  or a silicon liner, then coat liner with baking spray. Make
                  sure to grease sides of the baking sheet as well.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Add batter to baking sheet. Pour batter onto prepared 12x18
                  baking sheet and spread evenly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Bake. Bake at 350˚F for 12-15 minutes or until a toothpick
                  inserted into the center comes out clean.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Let cool. As soon as toothpick comes out clean, remove from
                  oven and let cool for at least 5 minutes, not more than 10.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Release cake from pan. While the cake is still warm, grab a
                  linen dish towel. Sprinkle both sides of the towel with
                  powdered sugar to prevent cake from sticking to it then lay it
                  on top of the cake. Holding the towel and pan together, gently
                  flip the pan upside down so the cake drops onto the towel. Tap
                  to release if needed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Roll cake. Peel parchment paper or silicon liner off of the
                  cake. Then tightly but gently roll the cake, keeping the towel
                  in place to separate the layers. Place the rolled cake,
                  seam-side down, on a cooling rack and let cool for at least 15
                  minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Unroll and add filling. When cooled, gently unroll the cake
                  and spread a layer of marshmallow frosting all the way to the
                  edges. Gently but tightly roll cake back up to form a log.
                  Place cake onto a serving dish, seam-side down.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Garnish. Add fresh cranberries and rosemary or decorate your
                  log. Or use your creativity to create a wintery scene using
                  whatever decorative items you would like. Mushrooms and
                  woodland creatures can be fun additions!

              <h2>Ingredients</h2>

              <ul class="Ingredients">
                <li>1 ¼ cup whole milk</li>
                <li>2 ¼ teaspoon active dry yeast (1 packet)</li>
                <li>4 ¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 ½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>¼ cup + 2 teaspoons granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
                <li>4 tablespoon unsalted butter melted</li>
                <li>1 egg at room temperature</li>
                <li>1 cup currants</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>How to make traditional hot cross buns</h2>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  Activate yeast. Heat milk until warm (around 110ºF), about 1
                  minute in the microwave. Sprinkle in yeast and 2 teaspoons of
                  sugar, stir to combine, allow to sit until foamy and yeast is
                  activated, 3-4 minutes. Whisk in melted butter and egg, set
                  aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Make the dough. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour,
                  sugar, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves until well combined.
                  Using an electric mixer with a dough hook attachment, add the
                  milk mixture to flour mixture; mix on medium-low until dough
                  begins to form, 1-2 minutes. Scrape down sides as needed and
                  continue to knead dough until a smooth, slightly tacky dough
                  is formed, 8-10 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Knead the dough. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured
                  surface. Knead in the currants, by adding ¼ cup of currants at
                  a time, folding the dough in on itself to incorporate, 2-3
                  minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  First rise. Place dough into a lightly greased bowl, cover,
                  and rise for 1 ½ hours.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Shape buns. Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish with
                  cooking spray. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface
                  from bowl. Cut dough in half, then cut each half into 6 equal
                  sized pieces, making 12 equal-sized pieces of dough.* Turn
                  piece of dough in on itself toward the center, making a ball
                  shape of dough. Place ball seam side down, cup hand and using
                  a circular motion, roll dough against the surface until a taut
                  ball of dough is formed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Second rise. Evenly space buns in prepared pan, cover, and
                  allow to rise for 1 ½ hours.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Make flour paste for crosses. In a small bowl, whisk together
                  flour, sugar, and water, mixing until just combined and no
                  lumps remain, 30-40 seconds.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Preheat. 5-10 minutes before buns are ready to bake, preheat
                  oven to 400ºF.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Pipe crosses. Right before baking, pipe flour mixture evenly
                  across the center of the 4 rows of buns, turn pan 90 degrees,
                  then pipe mixture over the 3 long rows, forming a cross shape
                  on each bun.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Bake. Bake buns for 20 minutes, if buns are becoming too dark,
                  tent with foil the final 5 minutes of baking.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Serve. warm or cool completely then store in an airtight
                  container.
